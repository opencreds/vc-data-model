claim,rdf:Property,claim,,Credential,,,@graph,A statement made about a `subject`. A **verifiable claim** is a claim that is tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be cryptographically verified.
credential,rdf:Property,credential,,Profile,Credential,,@graph,A set of one or more claims made by the same `entity` about a `subject`. A **verifiable credential** is a credential that is tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be cryptographically verified.
evidence,rdf:Property,evidence,,Credential,DocumentationVerifier,,,The value of this property MUST be one or more evidence schemes that provides enough information to a verifier to determine whether or not the evidence gathered meets their requirements.
issued,rdf:Property,issued,,Credential,xsd:dateTime,,,The value of this property MUST be a string value of an [[ISO8601]] combined date and time string and represents the date and time the `credential` was issued. Note that this date represents the earliest date when the information associated with the _claim property became valid.

Profile,rdfs:Class,Verifiable Profile,,,,,,A set of one or more `credentials` typically related to the same `subject`. An entity may have multiple `profiles` and each `profile` may contain `verifiable credentials` issued by multiple issuers. A `verifiable profile` is a `profile` that is tamper-resistant and whose contents are typically counter-signed by the `holder` or `subject`.
