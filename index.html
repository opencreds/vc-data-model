      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
Granting a benefit requires proof and verification. Some benefits demand
a formal process that includes three parties. In this process,
the <strong>holder</strong> asks for the benefit and the <strong>inspector-verifier
</strong> grants or denies the benefit based on verification of the holderâ€™s
qualification from a trusted <strong>issuer</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, we use a
driver's licenses to prove that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle,
a university degree to prove our education status, and government-issued
passports to grant travel between countries. This specification provides a
standard way to express these claims on the Web in a way that is
cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and automatically verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
For those that are unfamiliar with the concepts related to verifiable claims,
the following sections provide an overview of:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
what a verifiable claim contains,
        </li>
        <li>
an ecosystem where verifiable claims are expected to be useful, and
        </li>
        <li>
the use cases and requirements that informed this specification
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>What is a Verifiable Claim?</h3>

      <p class="issue">
Expand on introductory verifiable claims section that doesn't dive too deeply
into the details but rather provides an overview of what we're trying to
achieve.

    <section>
      <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

      <p>
This section outlines a basic set of roles and an ecosystem where verifiable
claims are expected to be useful. In this section, we distinguish the essential
roles of core actors and the relationships between them; how do they interact?
A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many different ways. The
separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and/or protocols for
standardization. The following roles are introduced in this specification:
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-title="Incomplete list of roles and terminology">
The VCWG is actively discussing the number of roles and terminology used
in this specification.
The group expects terminology and role identification to be an ongoing
discussion and will be influenced by
public feedback on the specification. At present, the following incomplete
list of roles and terminology have been considered: Subject, Issuer, Authority,
Author, Signatory, Holder, Presenter, Asserter, Claimant, Sharer,
Subject's Agent, Prover, Mediator, Inspector, Evaluator, Verifier, Consumer, and
Relying Party. Some of these are aliases for the same concept, others are
possibly new roles in the ecosystem. Reviewers should be aware that the
terminology used in this document is not necessarily final and the group is
actively soliciting feedback on the roles and terminology used in this
specification.

The ecosystem above is provided as an example to the reader in order to ground
the rest of the concepts in this specification. Other ecosystems exist, such as
protected environments or proprietary systems, where verifiable claims also
provide benefit.

      <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
      <p>
The Verifiable Claims Use Cases[[VC-USECASES]] document outlines a number of
key topics that readers may find useful, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
a more thorough explanation of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-roles">roles</a>
introduced above,
        </li>
        <li>
the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-needs">needs</a>
identified in market verticals like education, finance, healthcare, retail,
professional licensing, and government,
        </li>
        <li>
common
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-tasks">tasks and requirement</a>
performed by the roles in the ecosystem, and
        </li>
        <li>
common
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-sequences">sequences and flows</a>
identified by the Working Group.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, a number of
desirable capabilities have been identified as requirements for this
specification, specifically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST receive and store <a>verifiable claims</a> from
<a>issuers</a> through an agent that the issuer does not need to trust.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> SHOULD be positioned between <a>issuers</a> and <a>inspector-verifiers</a>
and mediate the transmission of <a>verifiable claims</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST provide <a>verifiable claims</a> to <a>inspector-verifiers</a>
through an agent that inspector-verifiers needn't trust; they only need to trust
<a>issuers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable claims</a> MUST be associated with <a>subjects</a>, not
particular services; <a>holders</a> SHOULD decide how to aggregate and manage
<a>verifiable claims</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> SHOULD be able to easily control and own their own identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST control which <a>verifiable claims</a> to use and when.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> MUST be able to freely choose and change the agents they employ
to help them manage and share their <a>verifiable claims</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> that share <a>verifiable claims</a> MUST NOT be required to
reveal the identity of the <a>inspector-verifier</a> to <a>issuers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>verifiable claim</a> MUST be expressed in one or more standard,
machine-readable data formats for expressing <a>verifiable claims</a> which
can also be extended with minimal coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable claims</a> MUST be able to be indepenently issued, stored, and
verified.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable Claims</a> MUST be able to be revoked by the <a>issuer</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="issue">
There are
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-tasks">other requirements</a>
listed in the Verifiable Claims Use Cases
document that may or may not be aligned with the requirements listed above.
The VCWG will be ensuring alignment of the list of requirements from both
documents over time and will most likely move the list of requirements to a
single document.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      </div>

      <p class="issue" data-number="55" data-title="Multiple subjects in a credential">
It is currently possible to include multiple subjects in a credential. The
terminology above glosses over that fact. The group is debating if the
terminology should be modified to include this nuance, or if the nuance would
make grasping the basic concepts more difficult.

      <h2>Core Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline core data model concepts, such as
<a>claims</a>, <a>credentials</a>, and <a>profiles</a>, that form the
foundation of this specification.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Claims</h3>

        <p>
A <a>claim</a> is statement about a <a>subject</a>.
A <a>subject</a> is an <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> may be made.
<a>Claims</a> are expressed using
<strong><em>subject</em></strong>-<dfn data-lt="property|properties">property</dfn>-<dfn>value</dfn>
relationships.
        </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/claim.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic structure of a claim.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
The data model for <a>claims</a> described above is powerful and can be used to
express a large variety of statements. For example, whether or not someone is
over the age of 21 may be expressed as follows:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/claim-example.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
An example of a basic claim that expresses that Pat is over the age of 21.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
These claims may be merged together to express a graph of
information about a particular subject. The example below extends the
data model above by adding claims that state that Pat knows Sam and that
Sam is a student.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="75%" src="diagrams/claim-extended.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
Multiple claims may be combined to express a more complex graph.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
At this point, the concept of a <a>claim</a> has been introduced. To make the
claim verifiable, more information must be added to the graph of information.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Credentials</h2>

      <p>
A <a>credential</a> is set of one or more <a>claims</a> about a <a>subject</a>.
It typically includes an identifier to uniquely identify the
credential. Credential metadata may also be included to express concepts
such as when the credential expires. A digital signature is almost always
appended by the <a>issuer</a> of the credential to enable verifiability of
the credential. Therefore, a <strong>verifiable credential</strong> is a set
of claims that are tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be
cryptographically verified.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="50%" src="diagrams/credential.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic components of a verifiable credential.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Examples of verifiable credentials include digital employee identification
cards, digital proofs of age, and digital educational certificates.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Profiles</h2>

      <p>
As this specification takes a privacy-first approach, it is important that
the entities that use this technology are able to express only the portions of
their persona that are appropriate for the situation. The expression of a
subset of one's persona is called a <a>verifiable profile</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>verifiable profile</a> is a collection of one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a> typically about the same <a>subject</a> that
have been issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. The aggregation of this
information typically expresses an aspect of a person, organization, or entity.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/profile.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic components of a verifiable profile.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Examples of different profiles include a person's professional persona, online
gaming persona, or home life persona.
      </p>

<!--
      <p>This section describes a data model for <a>verifiable
      profiles</a> and <a>verifiable credentials</a>, the latter covering
      both claims and verifiable claims, that is compatible with the
      requirements and use cases expected to be addressed by this
      group.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>General Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Both the <a>Verifiable Profile Model</a> and <a>Entity
        Credential Model</a> consist of a collection of name-value
        pairs which will be referred to as
        <dfn data-lt="property">properties</dfn> in this document.
        The following subsections describe the required and optional
        properties for both.  The link between the two is in
        the <var>id</var> property.  The <a>Verifiable Profile Model</a>
        defines a <a>subject</a> identifier in
        the <a href="#entity-id"><var>id</var></a> property, while
        the claims section of the <a>Verifiable Credential Model</a> uses
        the <a href="#claim-id"><var>id</var></a> property to refer to
        that <a>subject</a> identifier.</p>
        <p>This document purposely defines the data model without
        using a concrete syntax such as WebIDL, JSON, or JSON-LD to
        avoid implying a bias towards any particular one syntax.
        Section <a href="#syntaxes"></a>
        defines how the data model is to be expressed in those
        representation languages.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><dfn>Verifiable Profile Model</dfn></h2>
        <p>Unlike the <a>properties</a> in
        the <a href="#ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a> section of
        the <a>Verifiable Credential Model</a>, the <a>properties</a> in
        the Verifiable Profile Model are merely information that,
        together with a <a>subject</a>
        identifier <a href="#entity-id"><var>id</var></a>,
        constitute an verifiable profile.  The properties are not claims
        and are not intended to be verifiable.</p>
        <p>The following properties are required in the Entity
        Profile Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><span id="entity-id"><var>id</var></span></dt>
          <dd>This is a URI representing the <a>subject</a>.  This
          identifier MAY be long-lived but does not have to be.</dd>
          <dt><var>type</var></dt>
          <dd>This is an unordered set of URIs representing the types
          or classes of which this data set is a member.  As an
          <a>verifiable profile</a>, at a minimum the class "Entity"
          must be a member of the set.  Additional
          application-specific values are permitted in the set.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The following properties are optional in the Entity
        Profile Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>signature</var></dt>
          <dd>The method used for a signature will vary by
          representation language.  However, if present this property
          is expected to have a value that is a set of name-value
          pairs including at least a signature, a reference to the
          signing entity, and a representation of the signing
          date.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Additionally, any property name not listed above is
        permitted as an optional custom <a>property</a>.</p>

        <h2><dfn>Verifiable Credential Model</dfn></h2>
        <p>Unlike the <a>properties</a> in the <a>Verifiable Profile
        Model</a>, the <a>properties</a> in
        the <a href="#ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a> section of the
        Verifiable Credential Model are claims made by an <a>entity</a>
        about the <a>subject</a> defined in an <a>verifiable
        profile</a>.  The Verifiable Credential Model includes both
        issuance-related properties and the
        aforementioned <a href="#ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a>
        property that further contains the properties of the claim
        itself.</p>
        <p>The following properties are required in the Entity
        Credential Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>id</var></dt>
          <dd>URI representing this specific <a>verifiable credential</a></dd>

          <dd>This is an unordered set of URIs representing the types
          or classes of which this data set is a member.  As an
          <a>verifiable credential</a>, at a minimum the class
          "Credential" must be a member of the set.  Additional

      <h1>Verification</h1>

      <p>
This section describes a number of checks required to verify a claim.
Some checks are essential for all verifiable claims, while some are
applicable to only some claims.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Document is syntactically valid (e.g. JSON, JSON-LD).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Credential</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Required properties are present. For example, for a
          Credential, <code>type</code> and <code>claim</code> are
          required.</li>
          <li>Property values match expectations described in the
          specification. For example, the document type for a verifiable
          claim must contain the class "Credential".</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Issuer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>issuer</code> id must match expectations. Likely,
          that means it is the id of a known and trusted <a>verifiable
          profile</a>.</li>
          <li>Recent metadata about the <code>issuer</code> which was published
          by the issuer MUST be available.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Subject</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The claim subject identifier must match expectations.
          Likely, that means it is the id of a known and trusted
          <a>verifiable profile </a> for the subject of the claim. If the
          entity that is subject of a claim has transmitted it to the
          inspector-verifier, the subject may be able to prove ownership of key
          identifying properties such as email address(es) and public
          key(s).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Signature</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The document signature is available in the form of a known
          signature suite.</li>
          <li>Required signature properties are present. For example, for a
          Linked Data Signature, <code>type</code>, <code>created</code>,
          <code>creator></code>, and <code>signatureValue</code> are present.
          </li>
          <li>The public key associated with the signature is available
          and a trustworthy link between this signing key and the
          issuer's <a>verifiable profile</a> may be established. The key must
          not be revoked or expired.</li>
          <li>The cryptographic signature is valid.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Expiration</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>issued</code> date must be in the expected range.
          For example, an inspector-verifier may wish to ensure that the recorded
          issued date of valid claims is not in the future.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Revocation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If revocation instructions are present, the claim must not
          have been revoked.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Fitness for Purpose</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The custom properties in the <a>claim</a> should be
          appropriate for the inspector-verifier's purpose. For example if an
          inspector-verifier needs to determine that a subject is older than 21
          years of age, they may accept claims of specific birthdate or
          abstract properties such as <code>ageOver</code>.</li>
          <li>The issuer is trusted by the inspector-verifier to make the claims
          at hand. For example, Fast Food Resturant A will not be trusted
          to make a claim that an individual may enjoy a lifetime 10%
          discount to its competitor Fast Food Restaurant B.</li>
          <li>If the <a>issuer</a> has placed any policy information about
          the use of the <a>credential</a>, e.g. intended
          <a>inspector-verifiers</a>, expiration date, etc., that this
          policy is adhered to.</li>
          <li>If the <a>holder</a> has placed any policy information about
          the use of the <a>credential</a>, e.g. intended
          <a>inspector-verifiers</a>, restricted usage rights, etc., that this
          policy is adhered to.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Syntaxes</h2>

      <p>This section defines how the data model described in
      Section <a href="data-model"></a> is realized in each of 3
      different languages: JSON, JSON-LD, and WebIDL.  Although
      syntactic mappings are only provided for these three different
      languages, applications and services may also use any other data
      representation language (XML, for example) that can support the
      data model.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>JSON</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>Verifiable Credential</h2>
            <p>In JSON, an instance of the Verifiable Credential
            is expressed as a single JSON object whose
            properties are the verifiable credential's
            <a>properties</a>, with the following value type assignments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any number value MUST be represented as a Number type.</li>
              <li>Any boolean value MUST be represented as a Boolean type.</li>
              <li>Any sequence value MUST be represented as an Array type.</li>
              <li>Any unordered set of values MUST be represented as
              an Array type.</li>
              <li>Any set of <a>properties</a> MUST be represented as
              an Object type.</li>
              <li>Any empty value MUST be represented as a null value.</li>
              <li>Any other value MUST be represented as a String type.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express
            an <a>verifiable credential</a> containing a simple
            (unverifiable) <a>claim</a> about a particular
            <a>subject</a>. In this case, the claim is that
            the <a>subject</a> with
            the <a href="#entity-id">Verifiable Profile <var>id</var></a>
            of
            <code>did:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21</code> is 21 years
            of age or older. While a human reading the
            property <code>ageOver</code> may be able to guess its
            meaning by its name, no machine-readable semantics for the
            name are provided. There is information about the <a>claim</a>
            itself, such as an identifier for the <a>entity</a> that issued
            it and a date for when it was issued. </p>

  <span class="property">"ageOver": 21</span> <span class="comment">// property-value pair</span>
}</pre>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express the
            same <a>claim</a> about the same <a>subject</a>, but in a
            verifiable form. As such, it contains
            a <code>signature</code> that can be used to verify its
            entire contents, including the claim.</p>

        <h2>JSON-LD</h2>
        <p>JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]] is a data storage and expression
        approach called
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked
        Data</a>. It is a way of expressing information on the Web
        that is both simple and extensible.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Verifiable Credential</h2>
            <p>Instances of the <a>Verifiable Credential</a> are
            expressed in JSON-LD in the same way they are expressed in
            JSON
            (Section <a href="#expressing-an-entity-credential-in-json"></a>),
            except that there is an additional
            <a>property</a> <code>@context</code>.  Each property of
            the <a>verifiable credential</a> expression, along with each
            sub-property within the <code>claim</code> property (such
            as the generic <code>issuer</code> property or the
            app-specific <code>ageOver</code>), is given context via
            the <code>@context</code> value. Other contexts can be
            used or combined to express any arbitrary information
            about claims in idiomatic JSON.</p>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express a
            simple (unverifiable) <a>claim</a> about a particular
            <a>subject</a>. In this case, the claim is that
            the <a>subject</a> with
            the <a href="#entity-id">Entity
            Profile <var>id</var></a>
            of <code>did:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21</code> is 21
            years of age or older. While a human reading the
            property <code>ageOver</code> may be able to guess its
            meaning by its name, the context maps it to a global
            identifier (URL) where a document could be retrieved that
            provides its semantics in a machine-readable data
            format. There is also information about the <a>claim</a>
            itself, such as an identifier for the <a>entity</a> that
            issued it and a date for when it was issued.</p>

}</pre>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to express the
            same <a>claim</a> about the same <a>subject</a>, but in a
            verifiable form. As such, it contains
            a <code>signature</code> that can be used to verify its
            entire contents, including the claim.</p>

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying the verifiable claims data model into production
environments.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Spectrum of Privacy</h3>
        <p>
It is important to recognize that there is a spectrum of privacy that ranges
from pseudo-anonymous to strongly identified. Depending on the use case,
people have different appetites when it comes to what information they
are willing to provide and what information may be derived from what
is provided.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="80%"
            src="diagrams/privacy-spectrum.svg">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
- Privacy is a spectrum that ranges from pseudo-anonymous to fully identified.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
For example, one would most likely desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol because the regulatory check thatâ€™s required is solely whether or
not the person is above a particular age. However, when a doctor is writing a
prescription for a patient, the pharmacy fulfilling the prescription is
required to more strongly identify the medical professional. Therefore it
is important to recognize that there is not one approach to privacy that
works for all use cases; privacy solutions tend to be use case specific.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
Note that even if one may desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol, a photo ID may still be required to provide appropriate
assurance to the merchant. The merchant may not need to know your
name or other details (other than that you are over a certain age),
but in many cases a mere proof of age may still be insufficient to
meet regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
The Verifiable Claims data model strives to support the full spectrum of
privacy and does not take philosophical positions on the right level of
anonymity for any particular transaction. The following sections provide
guidance for implementers that want to avoid specific scenarios that are
hostile to privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

        <p>
The data associated with verifiable claims stored in the
<code>credential.claim</code> field are largely susceptible to privacy
violations when shared with Inspector-verifiers. Personally identifying data
such as a government-issued identifier, shipping address, and full name
can be easily used to determine, track, and correlate an entity. Even
information that does not seem personally identifiable like the
combination of a birth date and zip code have very powerful correlation
and de-anonymizing capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers are strongly advised to
warn Holders when they share data with these sorts of characteristics.
Issuers are strongly advised to provide privacy-protecting credentials
when possible. For example, issuing ageOver credentials instead of
birthdate credentials when the Inspector-verifier desires to determine if an
entity is over the age of 18.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Identifier-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
Subjects of verifiable claims are identified via the
<code>credential.claim.id</code> field. The identifiers that are used
to identify the subject of a claim create a danger of correlation when
the identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one web domain.
        </p>
        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are a requirement in a system using
verifiable claims, it is strongly advised that identifiers are bound to a
single origin or that identifiers are single-use or not used at all and
are replaced by short-lived, single use bearer tokens.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Signature-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
The contents of verifiable claims are secured via the
<code>credential.signature</code> field. The
<code>credential.signature.signatureValue</code> field creates a danger
of correlation when it is used across more than one web domain and the
value does not change.
        </p>

        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are desired,
it is strongly advised that signature values and metadata are regenerated
each time using technologies like group signatures.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Device Fingerprinting</h3>

        <p>
There are mechanisms external to Verifiable Claims that are used to track and
correlate individuals on the Internet and the Web. Some of these mechanisms
include Internet Protocol address tracking, Web Browser fingerprinting,
Evercookies, Advertising Network trackers, mobile network position information,
and in-application Global Positioning System APIs. The use of Verifiable
Claims cannot prevent the use of these other tracking technologies. In addition,
when these technologies are used in concert with Verifiable Claims, new
correlatable information may be discovered. For example, a birthday coupled
with a GPS position can be used to strongly correlate an individual across
multiple websites.
        </p>

        <p>
It is advised that privacy preserving systems prevent the use of these other
tracking technologies when verifiable claims are being utilized. In some cases,
these tracking technologies may need to be disabled entirely on devices that
transmit verifiable claims on behalf of the Holder.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Favor Abstract Claims</h3>

        <p>
In order to enable recipients of verifiable claims to use them in a variety of circumstances without revealing more personally identifiable information than necessary for the transaction, issuers should consider limiting the information published in a claim to a minimal set needed for the expected purposes.
One way to avoid placing personally identifiable information in a claim is to use an "abstract" property that meets the needs of inspector-verifiers without providing specific information about the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
An example in this document is the use of the <code>ageOver</code> property as opposed to a specific birthdate that would constitute much stronger personally identifiable information.
If retailers in a market commonly require purchasers to be older than a specific age, an issuer trusted in that market may choose to offer a credential claiming that subjects have met that requirement as opposed to offering claims of their specific birthdates.
This enables individual customers to purchase items without revealing specific personally identifiable information.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Principle of Minimum Disclosure</h3>

        <p>
Privacy violations occur when information divulged in one context leaks into
another. Accepted best practice for preventing such violations is to limit
the information requested, and received, to the absolute minimum necessary.
This minimal disclosure approach is required by regulation in multiple
jurisdictions, including HIPAA in the US and GDPR in the EU.
        </p>
        <p>
With verifiable claims, minimal disclosure for issuers means limiting the
content of a claim to the minimum required by potential inspector-verifiers for
expected use. For inspector-verifiers, it means limiting the scope of claims
request or required for accessing services.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, a driver's license containing a driver's ID number,
height, weight, birthday, and home address is an example of a claim set
containing more information than is necessary to establish that the person
is above a certain age.
        </p>

        <p>
It is considered a best practice for issuers to atomize information or
use a signature scheme that allows for selective disclosure.
For example, an issuer
that issues driver's licenses could issue a claim set containing every
attribute that appears on a driver's license in addition to individual
claims (a singular claim containing the person's birthday), and individual
claims that are more abstract (a singular claim containing an
<code>ageOver</code> attribute). In addition, the issuer is encouraged to
provide secure HTTP endpoints for retrieving single-use bearer claims to
promote the pseudonymous usage of claims when it is safe for the issuer to
issue such claims.
        </p>
        <p>
Similarly, inspector-verifiers are urged to only request information that is absolutely
necessary for a particular transaction to occur. This is important for at
least two reasons: 1) it reduces the liability on the inspector-verifier for
handling highly sensitive information that it does not need, and 2)
it enhances the privacy of the individual by only asking for information
that is required for the particular transaction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Bearer Claims</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Bearer claims containing PII or unique identifiers can be correlated.
Bearer claims can be tracked based on usage patterns.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Validity Checks</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Inspector-verifier (corporation) is required to check revocation via Issuer
(government).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Storage Providers and Data Mining</h3>

        <p>
When a holder receives a claim from an issuer, the
claim will need to be stored somewhere (e.g. in a credential repository).
Holders are warned that the information in a verifiable claim may be
sensitive in nature and highly individualized, making it a high value
target for data mining. Therefore, there may be services
that store verifiable claims for free and mine personal data and sell it
to organizations that desire individualized profiles on people and
organizations (i.e. if the service is free, you are the product).
        </p>
        <p>
It is suggested that holders be aware of the terms of service for their
credential repository, specifically the correlation and data mining
protections that are in place for those who store their verifiable claims
at the service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
There are a number of effective mitigations for data mining and profiling:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Use service providers that do not sell your information to third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that encrypts verifiable claims such that a service provider
cannot view the contents of the claims.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that stores verifiable claims locally on a device that you
control and that does not upload or analyze your information beyond
your expectations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Aggregation of Claims</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Aggregation of claims can reveal more information than just the attributes
being aggregated.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>

        <p>
Despite the best efforts to assure privacy, the actual use of verifiable
claims can potentially lead to de-anonymization and a loss of privacy.
This correlation can occur:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
When the same claim is presented to the same inspector-verifier more than once â€“
that inspector-verifier could infer that the holder is the same individual.
          </li>
          <li>
When the same claim is presented to different inspector-verifiers, and either those
inspector-verifiers collude or a third party has access to transaction records from
both inspector-verifiers â€“ the observant party could infer that the individual
presenting the claims is the same person at both services, i.e., the
accounts are controlled by the same person.
          </li>
          <li>
When the same subject identifier of a claim refers to the same subject across
presentations or inspector-verifiers. Even when different claims are presented,
if the subject identifier is the same, inspector-verifiers (and those with access to
inspector-verifier logs) could infer that the holder of the claims is the same
person.
          </li>
          <li>
When the underlying information in a claim can be used to identify an
individual across services â€“ using information from other sources
(including information provided directly by the user), inspector-verifiers can use
the information inside the claim to correlate the individual with an
existing profile. For example, if a holder presents claims that include
zip code, age, and sex, the inspector-verifier can potentially correlate the
subject of that claim with an established profile [see Sweeney 2000 <a href="http://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf">Simple
            Demographics Often Identify People Uniquely</a>].
          </li>
          <li>
When passing the identifier of a claim to a centralized revocation server â€“ the
centralized server can correlate the claim usage across interactions. For
example, if a verifiable claim is used for proof of age in this manner, the
centralized service could know everywhere that claim was presented: all
liquor stores, bars, adult stores, lottery purchases, etc.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
Itâ€™s possible to mitigate this in part:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
Use a globally unique identifier as the subject for any given claim and never
re-use that claim.
          </li>
          <li>
If the claim supports revocation, use a globally distributed service for revocation.
          </li>
          <li>
Design revocation APIs that do not depend on submitting the ID
of the claim, e.g., use a revocation list rather than a query.
          </li>
          <li>
Avoid associating personally identifiable information with any particular
long-lived subject identifier.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It is understood that these mitigation techniques are not always practical
or even compatible with necessary usage. Sometimes correlation is the point.
        </p>
        <p>
In state prescription monitoring programs, usage monitoring is a
requirement: enforcement entities need to be able to confirm that
individuals are not cheating the system to get multiple prescriptions
for controlled substances. This statutory or regulatory need to correlate
usage overrides individual privacy concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
Verifiable claims will so be used to intentionally correlate individuals
across services, for example, when using a common persona to log in to
multiple services, so all activity on each of those services is
intentionally linked to the same individual. This is not a privacy issue
as long as each of those services uses the correlation in the expected
manner.
        </p>

        <p>
Privacy risks of claim usage occur when unintended or unexpected
correlation arises from the presentation of verifiable claims.

        <h3>Bundling Dependent Claims</h3>
        <p>
It is considered a best practice for issuers to atomize information in a
credential, or use a signature scheme that allows for selective disclosure.
In the former case, if the atomization is not done securely by the issuer,
the holder may bundle together different credentials in a way that was not
intended by the issuer.
        </p>
        <p>
For example a university might issue two credentials to a person, each
containing two properties i.e. "Staff Member" in the
"Department of Computing" and "Post Graduate Student" in the
Deptartment of Economics. If these credentials are atomized into separate
properties, then the university would issue four credentials to the person,
each containing one of the following properties:
"Staff Member", "Post Graduate Student", "Deptartment of Computing" and
"Department of Economics". The holder could then transfer
the "Staff Member" and "Department of Economics" to an inspector-verifier,
which together would comprise a false claim.
