      <p>
A self-sovereign architecture for verifiable claims is one where the
holder of a verifiable claim is in complete control of their
identifier, where their verifiable claims are stored, and how they are
used. There is currently no widely used self-sovereign,
privacy-enhancing standard for expressing and transacting verifiable
claims (aka: credentials, attestations) via the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification describes a data model for a digital <a>identity
profile</a> and a collection of digital <a>entity credentials</a> that
assert verifiable <a>claims</a> about that <a>identity profile</a>. It also
describes how to express that data model in JSON, JSON-LD, and WebIDL.

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>Drawn initially from
      [[IDENTITY-CREDENTIALS]], this
      document is intended to provide a rough outline of the kind of
      standardization work that a Verifiable Claims Working Group
      might do.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      We typically use credentials, or claims made by
      others about our identities, to authenticate ourselves and
      ultimately gain access to various services. For example, we use
      email addresses to identify ourselves to online services,
      driver's licenses to prove that we are capable of operating a
      motor vehicle, university degrees to prove we are well-trained
      and knowledgeable, and government-issued passports to travel
      between countries or to access financial services. It is the
      goal of this specification to provide an easy, standard way to
      express such credentials on the Web.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are a number of desirable capabilities for these kinds of
      credentials, referred to in this specification as <a>entity
      credentials</a>, that have been identified as requirements for
      this specification:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Entity credentials</a> refer to an architecture where:
          <ul>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders are positioned in the middle between issuers and inspectors.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders receive and store credentials from issuers through an
agent that the issuer does not need to trust.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders provide credentials to credential inspectors through
an agent that inspectors needn't trust; they only need to trust issuers.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credentials</a> are associated with identities, not particular services; credential
holders can decide how to aggregate credentials and manage their own
identities.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders can control and own their own identifiers.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders can control which credentials to use and when.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders may freely choose and swap out the agents they employ to
help them manage and share their credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
<a>Entity credential</a> holders that share verifiable claims are not required to reveal the
identity of the inspector to their agent or to issuers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
A standard, machine-readable data format for expressing <a>entity credentials</a>
that can be extended with minimal coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
Independent issuance, storage, and cryptographic verification of <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A standard mechanism for requesting <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The ability to revoke previously issued <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Web Browser APIs for storing and consuming <a>entity credentials</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This specification is based upon work presented in
      [[IDENTITY-CREDENTIALS]].  In particular, examples from that
      document have been used to infer a simple but extensible data
      model capable of representing the unbounded variety
      of attributes that could be claimed in <a>entity
      credentials</a>.  This document is intended to provide only one
      example of what could potentially be defined and standardized in
      a Recommendation-track Working Group at W3C.  The two pieces of
      possible standardization work demonstrated in this document
      are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A generic data model covering the minimum information
        necessary to create and use <a>entity credentials</a> that
        would meet the needs described in the [[VCTF-USECASES]]
        Document.</li>
        <li>Instructions on how to express specific instances of the
        data model in three different syntactic formulations: JSON,
        JSON-LD, and WebIDL.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The remainder of this specification is structured as follows:
first, some general definitions of terms are provided.  Second, the
data model is described in text prose to avoid any suggestion of bias
in terms of syntactic representation.  It is also presented as a UML
diagram. Third, instructions are provided for how to express instances
of the data model in terms of JSON, JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]], and
WebIDL.</p>

        <h2>General Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Both the <a>Identity Profile Model</a> and <a>Entity
        Credential Model</a> consist of a collection of name-value
        pairs which will be referred to as
        <dfn data-lt="property">properties</dfn> in this document.
        The following subsections describe the required and optional
        properties for both.  The link between the two is in
        the <var>id</var> property.  The <a>Identity Profile Model</a>
        defines a <a>subject</a> identifier in
        the <a href="#identity-id"><var>id</var></a> property, while
        the claims section of the <a>Entity Credential Model</a> uses
        the <a href="#claim-id"><var>id</var></a> property to refer to
        that <a>subject</a> identifier.</p>
        <p>This document purposely defines the data model without
        using a concrete syntax such as WebIDL, JSON, or JSON-LD to
        avoid implying a bias towards any particular one syntax.
        Section <a href="#expressing-identity-profiles-entity-credentials-and-verifiable-claims"></a>
        defines how the data model is to be expressed in those
        representation languages.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><dfn>Identity Profile Model</dfn></h2>
        <p>Unlike the <a>properties</a> in
        the <a href="#ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a> section of
        the <a>Entity Credential Model</a>, the <a>properties</a> in
        the Identity Profile Model are merely information that,
        together with a <a>subject</a>
        identifier <a href="#identity-id"><var>id</var></a>,
        constitute an identity profile.  The properties are not claims
        and are not intended to be verifiable.</p>
        <p>The following properties are required in the Identity
        Profile Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><span id="identity-id"><var>id</var></span></dt>
          <dd>This is a URI representing the <a>subject</a>.  This
          identifier MAY be long-lived but does not have to be.</dd>
          <dt><var>type</var></dt>
          <dd>This is an unordered set of URIs representing the types
          or classes of which this data set is a member.  As an
          <a>identity profile</a>, at a minimum the class "Identity"
          must be a member of the set.  Additional
          application-specific values are permitted in the set.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The following properties are optional in the Identity
        Profile Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>signature</var></dt>
          <dd>The method used for a signature will vary by
          representation language.  However, if present this property
          is expected to have a value that is a set of name-value
          pairs including at least a signature, a reference to the
          signing entity, and a representation of the signing
          date.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Additionally, any property name not listed above is
        permitted as an optional custom <a>property</a>.</p>

        <h2><dfn>Entity Credential Model</dfn></h2>
        <p>Unlike the <a>properties</a> in the <a>Identity Profile
        Model</a>, the <a>properties</a> in
        the <a href="#ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a> section of the
        Entity Credential Model are claims made by an <a>entity</a>
        about the <a>subject</a> defined in an <a>identity
        profile</a>.  The Entity Credential Model includes both
        issuance-related properties and the
        aforementioned <a href="ec-claim"><var>claim</var></a>
        property that further contains the properties of the claim
        itself.</p>
        <p>The following properties are required in the Entity
        Credential Model:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>id</var></dt>
          <dd>URI representing this specific <a>entity credential</a></dd>
          <dt><var>type</var></dt>
          <dd>This is an unordered set of URIs representing the types
          or classes of which this data set is a member.  As an
          <a>entity credential</a>, at a minimum the class
          "Credential" must be a member of the set.  Additional
          application-specific values are permitted in the
          set.</dd>
          <dt><span id="ec-claim"><var>claim</var></span></dt>
          <dd>This is the actual claim.  Its value is a set of
          <a>properties</a> as follows:
            <p>The following properties are required in
            a <var>claim</var> value:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt><span id="claim-id"><var>id</var></span></dt>
              <dd>The <a>subject</a> of the claim, the property value
              is expected to be a valid
              <a href="#identity-id">Identity Profile <var>id</var></a>.</dd>
              <dt>At least one custom <a>property</a></dt>

          <h2>Expressing an Identity Profile in WebIDL</h2>
            <p>In WebIDL, an instance of the <a>Identity Profile
            Model</a> is expressed as an Interface whose attributes
            are the identity profile's <a>properties</a>, with the
            following value type assignments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any number value MUST be represented as an
              appropriate valid numeric type, e.g. double or unsigned
              long.</li>
              <li>Any boolean value MUST be represented as a boolean type.</li>
              <li>Any sequence value MUST be represented as a sequence
              type.</li>
              <li>Any unordered set of values MUST be represented as

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying the verifiable claims data model into production
environments.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Spectrum of Privacy</h3>
        <p>
It is important to recognize that there is a spectrum of privacy that ranges
from pseudo-anonymous to strongly identified. Depending on the use case,
people have different appetites when it comes to what information they
are willing to provide and what information may be derived from what
is provided.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="80%"
            src="privacy-spectrum.svg">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
- Privacy is a spectrum that ranges from pseudo-anonymous to fully identified.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
For example, one would most likely desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol because the regulatory check that’s required is solely whether or
not the person is above a particular age. However, when a doctor is writing a
prescription for a patient, the pharmacy fulfilling the prescription is
required to more strongly identify the medical professional. Therefore it
is important to recognize that there is not one approach to privacy that
works for all use cases; privacy solutions tend to be use case specific.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
Note that even if one may desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol, a photo ID may still be required to provide appropriate
assurance to the merchant. The merchant may not need to know your
name or other details (other than that you are over a certain age),
but in many cases a mere proof of age may still be insufficient to
meet regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
The Verifiable Claims data model strives to support the full spectrum of
privacy and does not take philosophical positions on the right level of
anonymity for any particular transaction. The following sections provide
guidance for implementers that want to avoid specific scenarios that are
hostile to privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

        <p>
The data associated with verifiable claims stored in the
<code>credential.claim</code> field are largely susceptible to privacy
violations when shared with Inspectors. Personally identifying data
such as a government-issued identifier, shipping address, and full name
can be easily used to determine, track, and correlate an entity. Even
information that does not seem personally identifiable like the
combination of a birth date and zip code have very powerful correlation
and de-anonymizing capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers are strongly advised to
warn Holders when they share data with these sorts of characteristics.
Issuers are strongly advised to provide privacy-protecting credentials
when possible. For example, issuing ageOver credentials instead of
birthdate credentials when the Inspector desires to determine if an
entity is over the age of 18.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Identifier-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
Subjects of verifiable claims are identified via the
<code>credential.claim.id</code> field. The identifiers that are used
to identify the subject of a claim create a danger of correlation when
the identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one web domain.
        </p>
        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are a requirement in a system using
verifiable claims, it is strongly advised that identifiers are bound to a
single origin or that identifiers are single-use or not used at all and
are replaced by short-lived, single use bearer tokens.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Signature-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
The contents of verifiable claims are secured via the
<code>credential.signature</code> field. The
<code>credential.signature.signatureValue</code> field creates a danger
of correlation when it is used across more than one web domain and the
value does not change.
        </p>

        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are desired,
it is strongly advised that signature values and metadata are regenerated
each time using technologies like group signatures.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Device Fingerprinting</h3>

        <p>
There are mechanisms external to Verifiable Claims that are used to track and
correlate individuals on the Internet and the Web. Some of these mechanisms
include Internet Protocol address tracking, Web Browser fingerprinting,
Evercookies, Advertising Network trackers, mobile network position information,
and in-application Global Positioning System APIs. The use of Verifiable
Claims cannot prevent the use of these other tracking technologies. In addition,
when these technologies are used in concert with Verifiable Claims, new
correlatable information may be discovered. For example, a birthday coupled
with a GPS position can be used to strongly correlate an individual across
multiple websites.
        </p>

        <p>
It is advised that privacy preserving systems prevent the use of these other
tracking technologies when verifiable claims are being utilized. In some cases,
these tracking technologies may need to be disabled entirely on devices that
transmit verifiable claims on behalf of the Holder.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Favor Abstract Claims</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Favor “proof of” vs. “actual data”. Example: overAge: 21 vs. birthdate.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Atomize Information for Principle of Least Authority</h3>

        <p class="issue">
When issuing information, issue it in the smallest pieces possible.
When requesting information, only ask for the data points that you need.
Issue abstract claims alongside actual data when possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Bearer Claims</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Bearer claims containing PII or unique identifiers can be correlated.
Bearer claims can be tracked based on usage patterns.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Validity Checks</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Inspector (corporation) is required to check revocation via Issuer
(government).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Storage Providers and Data Mining</h3>

        <p>
When a holder receives a claim from an issuer, the
claim will need to be stored somewhere (e.g. in a credential repository).
Holders are warned that the information in a verifiable claim may be
sensitive in nature and highly individualized, making it a high value
target for data mining. Therefore, there may be services
that store verifiable claims for free and mine personal data and sell it
to organizations that desire individualized profiles on people and
organizations (i.e. if the service is free, you are the product).
        </p>
        <p>
It is suggested that holders be aware of the terms of service for their
credential repository, specifically the correlation and data mining
protections that are in place for those who store their verifiable claims
at the service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
There are a number of effective mitigations for data mining and profiling:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Use service providers that do not sell your information to third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that encrypts verifiable claims such that a service provider
cannot view the contents of the claims.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that stores verifiable claims locally on a device that you
control and that does not upload or analyze your information beyond
your expectations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Aggregation of Claims</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Aggregation of claims can reveal more information than just the attributes
being aggregated.

      <section>
        <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>

        <p class="issue">
When verifiable claims are used can be used for correlation purposes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Sharing Information with the Wrong Party</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Tokenize identifiers (like bank account numbers) when possible.
Granting of rights to a service via cryptographic mechanisms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Frequency of Claim Issuance</h3>

        <p class="issue">
The rate at which an issuer issues claims may be a privacy violation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Prefer Single Use Claims</h3>

        <p class="issue">
Single-use, origin bound claims are generally safer than long-lived
claims.

      <h2>Verification</h2>

      <p>
This section describes a number of checks required to verify a claim.
Some checks are essential for all verifiable claims, while some are
applicable to only some claims.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Structural Validity</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Document is valid JSON-LD.</li>
            <li>Required properties are present. For example, for a
            Credential, <code>type</code> and <code>claim</code> are
            required.</li>
            <li>Property values match expectations described in the
            specification. For example, the document type for a verifiable
            claim must contain the class "Credential".</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Entity Validity</h3>
        <p>
A number of checks must be implemented to ensure a set of entities related
to a Credential have mutually compatible properties and are trustworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <code>issuer</code> id must match expectations. Likely,
            that means it is the id of a known and trusted <a>identity
            profile</a>.</li>
            <li>The claim subject identifier must match expectations.
            Likely, that means it is the id of a known and trusted
            <a>identity profile </a> for the subject of the claim. If the
            entity that is subject of a claim has transmitted it to the
            inspector, the subject may be able to prove ownership of key
            identifying properties such as email address(es) and public
            key(s).</li>
            <li>The <code>issued</code> date must be in the expected range.
            For example, an inspector may wish to ensure that the recorded
            issued date of valid claims is not in the future.</li>
            <li>The document signature is available in the form of a known
            signature suite.</li>
            <li>The public key associated with the signature is available
            and a trustworthy link between this signing key and the
            issuer's <a>identity profile</a> may be established.</li>
            <li>If revocation instructions are present, the claim must not
            have been revoked.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>The <a>custom properties</a> in the <a>claim</a> should be
            appropriate for the inspector's purpose. For example if an
            inspector needs to determine that a subject is older than 21
            years of age, they may accept claims of specific birthdate or
            abstract properties such as <code>ageOver</code>.</li>
            <li>The issuer is trusted by the inspector to make the claims
            at hand. For example, Fast Food Resturant A will not be trusted
            to make a claim that an individual may enjoy a lifetime 10%
            discount to its competitor Fast Food Restaurant B.</li>
