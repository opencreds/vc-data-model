<p>
  The following terms are used to describe concepts involved with
  <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>
</p>

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn data-lt="claims">claim</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An assertion made about a <a>subject</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of one or more <a>claims</a> made by an issuer.
A <dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn>
is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be
cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build
<a>verifiable presentations</a>, which can also be cryptographically verified.
  </dd>
  <dd>
Note: The claims in a credential can be about different subjects.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential validation">validation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process of demonstrating that the information in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a> is well-formed.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a <strong>DID</strong>,
associated with an <a>entity</a>. These identifiers are most often used in a
<a>credential</a> and are associated with <a>holders</a> such that a
<a>credential</a> itself can be easily ported from one <a>repository</a> to
another without the need to reissue the <a>credential</a>. An example of a DID
is <code>did:example:123456abcdef</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A document that is accessible using an verifiable data registry and contains
information related to a specific <a>decentralized identifier</a>, such as the
associated <a>repository</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>digital signature</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="predicates|derived predicates">derived predicate</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A verifiable, boolean assertion about the value of another attribute in a
<a>verifiable credential</a>. These are useful in zero-knowledge-proof-style
presentations because they can limit information disclosure. For example, if a
<a>verifiable credential</a> contains an attribute named "height_in_cm", a
derived predicate, such as "height_over_150cm", might reference the height
attribute in the credential and demonstrate that the issuer attests to a
height value meeting the minimum height requirement, without actually
disclosing the specific height value.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A thing with distinct and independent existence, such as a person,
organization, concept, or device. An entity may perform one or more roles in
the ecosystem.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="graphs">graph</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A network of information composed of <a>subjects</a> and their relationship
to other subjects or data.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="holders|holder's">holder</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> can perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. A holder is usually, but not always,
the <a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credentials</a> they are holding.
Holders store their <a>credentials</a> in <a>credential repositories</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identities|identity's">identity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The means for keeping track of <a>entities</a> across contexts. Digital
identities enable tracking and customization of entity interactions across
digital contexts, typically using identifiers and attributes. Unintended
distribution or use of identity information can compromise privacy. Collection
and use of such information should follow the principles of minimal disclosure.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable data registries">Verifiable data registry</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role a system may perform by mediating the creation and verification of
<a>subject</a> identifiers, verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries,
issuer public keys, etc. Some registries, such as ones for UUIDs and
public keys, act merely as namespaces for identifiers.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity providers|idp">identity provider</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An identity provider, sometimes abbreviated as <em>IdP</em>, is a system
for creating, maintaining, and managing identity information for
<a>holders</a>, while providing authentication services to
<a>relying party</a> applications within a federation or distributed network.
In this case the <a>holder</a> is always the <a>subject</a>. Even if the
credentials are bearer credentials, it is assumed they will remain with the
subject, and if they are not, they were stolen by an attacker. This
specification does not use this term unless comparing or mapping the concepts
in this document to other specifications. This specification decouples the
identity provider concept into two distinct concepts: the <a>issuer</a>,
and the <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="issuers|issuer's">issuer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by asserting <a>claims</a> about one or
more <a>subjects</a>, creating a <a>verifiable credential</a> from these
claims, and transmitting the verifiable credential to a <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="presentations">presentation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Data derived from one or more <a>credentials</a>, issued by one or more
<a>issuers</a>, that is shared with a specific <a>verifier</a>. A
<dfn data-lt="verifiable presentations">verifiable presentation</dfn>
is a tamper-evident presentation that is encoded such that authorship of the
data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain
types of verifiable presentations might contain data that is synthesized from,
but do not contain, the original verifiable credentials (for example,
zero-knowledge proofs).
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential repository|credential repositories|repositories">repository</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a storage vault or personal
<a>verifiable credential</a> wallet, that stores and protects access to
<a>holder</a> credentials.</dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects|subject's">subject</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> are made.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between <a>holders</a>, <a>issuers</a>, and <a>verifiers</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifier|verifiers|verifier's|credential verifiers|credential verifier's">verifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by receiving one or more
<a>verifiable presentations</a> for processing. Other specifications might refer
to this concept as a <dfn data-lt="relying parties">relying party</dfn>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verification">verification</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process of cryptographically demonstrating the authenticity of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>.
  </dd>
</dl>
