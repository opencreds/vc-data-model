      <h1>Comparison of Verifiable Credentials with SAML and OIDC</h1>

      <p>
Existing federated identity management (FIM) systems suffer from a
number of problems, in particular with regard to their trust model,
economic models and the privacy of their users.
      </p>

      <p>
The FIM trust model requires the Identity Provider (IdP)
to trust the Service Provider (SP) to preserve the privacy of the user’s
identity attributes (or credentials) that it is asserting, and the SP to
trust that the IdP is the authoritative source of all of the user’s
identity attributes. Both of these trust requirements are problematic.
No single IdP is the authoritative source of all a user’s identity
attributes, and users may, for very good reason, want to present their
identity attributes to SPs that IdPs do not fully trust. Consequently
IdPs are not willing or able to release the user attributes that SPs
require in order to provide users with the fine grained authorization
they need. “Insufficient attribute release by IdPs is considered by user
communities as the major problem today in the eduGAIN space” [4]. This
necessitates the pulling of user identity attributes from other
Attribute Authorities (AAs). In order to solve this 'attribute
aggregation' problem, the assignment of a persistent globally unique
identifier to each user is proposed by many [5, 6]. But this has severe
privacy implications for the user, as it provides a correlating handle
that can be used to track the user everywhere. Worse still, IdPs do not
provide their users with any service to most SPs, since the latter are
not part of the IdP’s federation, and so are considered to be not
trusted. Finally, the IdPs are the center of the identity eco-system,
and issue short-lived identity assertions [7] or tokens [8] on demand to
trusted SPs. Consequently, they know which SPs the user is visiting and
when, which is privacy invasive and allows them to track the user.
      </p>

      <p>
Landau and More [9] document four economic tussles in current FIM
systems and show why some have been more successful than others. In
essence every participant: IdP, SP and user, has to gain from the FIM
system otherwise it will fail to be widely adopted.
      </p>

      <p>
By way of comparison, consider the use of plastic cards, passports,
driving licenses and other such physical credentials in the world today.
They are ubiquitous and massively successful. In this trust model, only
the SP has to trust that the IdP is the authoritative source of the
identity attribute(s) in the credential. Users are in control of their
identity, and can show their credentials to any SPs they wish, without
the permission of the IdP. Furthermore an IdP may not be aware that a SP
has seen its credential and used it for authorisation. The user can
combine or aggregate credentials as required by a SP. This model does
not require the separation of IdPs and SPs, since they can be the same
entity e.g. Tesco and its Clubcard. But if there is economic benefit
then new SPs may dynamically join the system e.g. Esso petrol stations
now accept Tesco Clubcards. Economic tussles are minimized.
      </p>

      <p>
Verifiable Credentials are the electronic equivalent of today’s physical
credentials but are more privacy preserving as they do not reveal the
user’s name, unless consented to. VCs may contain as little as a single
identity attribute, allowing the user to minimally disclose the
attributes that he or she wishes.
